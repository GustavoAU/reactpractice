# React + Vite: Dynamic Theme Practice

This project is a practical application of React fundamentals, featuring a theme-switching interface (Light/Dark mode) with dynamic background generation.

## 🚀 Concepts Applied

- **useState Hook:** Managed multiple states for theme switching and image randomization.
- **Props & Destructuring:** Implemented efficient data passing between `App` and `Card` components.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Dynamically toggled UI text and styles based on the current state.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Used **Template Literals** for class switching and inline styles for background image manipulation.
- **Data Structure Management:** Organized assets into a centralized constants file for cleaner code architecture.
